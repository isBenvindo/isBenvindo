## 🚀 About Me

I hold a degree in **Systems Analysis and Development** from the **Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Piauí (IFPI)**.

I currently work as a **Systems Developer**, focusing on **Delphi** and **Microsoft SQL Server** in enterprise environments.

I am also part of an **Embedded Systems Residency Program**, where I work hands-on with **Python, FastAPI, Grafana, ESP32 (C/C++)**, and IoT solutions.

My professional interests include **Python development, Business Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, always aiming to bridge software systems with real-world hardware applications.
